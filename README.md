V Bindings for OpenCV

> [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) is the world's biggest computer vision library. This project provides V bindings for the OpenCV library.

This is an initial attempt to create an OpenCV binding for Vlang. The C interface was borrowed from [gocv](https://github.com/hybridgroup/gocv), and the implementation has been highly influenced by it.
